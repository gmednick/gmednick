I started my programming journey with Python and eventually decided to learn R because of the Bioconductor project (a repository with over 2000 high quality packages for biological data analysis). In the process of getting to know
R, I fell in love with data science, the R community, the tidyverse suite of packages and,
the tidymodels suite for machine learning. I have also developing expertise with Shiny, an R package for creating reactive web applications.

Also, I want to give a shout out to all of you Python lovers out there. I've been rekindling the flame with Python and hope to make time to post some Python projects on my website soon (as in 2023)!
