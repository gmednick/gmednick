I started my programming journey with Python and eventually decided to learn R because of the Bioconductor project (a repository with over 2000 high quality packages for biological data analysis). In the process of getting to know
R, I fell in love with data science, the R community, the Tidyverse and the Tidymodels suite of packages for machine learning. 

I spend most of my time developing awesome Shiny web application tools that bring my data science and bioinformatics analyses to life.
