### I am a Data Scientist, Computational Biologist, Educator & Biochemist. I started my programming 
journey with python and eventually decided to learn R because of the Bioconductor project (a repository
of over 2000 high quality packages for biological data analysis). In the process of getting to know
R, I fell in love with data science using the tidyverse and, more recently, the tidymodels suite for
machine learning.
