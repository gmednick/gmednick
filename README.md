 ### I am a Data Scientist, Computational Biologist, Educator & Biochemist who loves everything :raised_hands:**R**:raised_hands:
 
I started my programming journey with python and eventually decided to learn R because of the Bioconductor project (a repository
with over 2000 high quality packages for biological data analysis). In the process of getting to know
R, I fell in love with data science, the R community, the tidyverse suite of packages and, more recently, 
the tidymodels suite for machine learning. ..Even more recently, I've been enjoying the Blogdown package
for website creation and Shiny Dashboard for creating reactive web applications with R.
